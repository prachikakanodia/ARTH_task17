# ARTH_task17

Task Description:

🔅 Create your own Chat Servers, and establish a network to transfer data using Socket Programing by creating both Server and Client machine as Sender and Receiver both. Do this program using UDP data transfer protocol.

🔅 Use multi-threading concept to get and receive data parallelly from both the Server Sides. Observe the challenges that you face to achieve this using UDP.

# Some key concepts used are:

✔ 𝗦𝗢𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗧 𝗣𝗬𝗧𝗛𝗢𝗡 𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗚𝗥𝗔𝗠𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗚: It is a way of connecting and processing two nodes/hosts using networking concepts to communicate with each other.

✔ 𝗠𝗨𝗟𝗧𝗜-𝗧𝗛𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗗𝗜𝗡𝗚: It enables the processing of multiple threads at one time, rather than multiple processes.

✔ 𝗨𝗗𝗣 𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗔 𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗡𝗦𝗙𝗘𝗥 𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗧𝗢𝗖𝗢𝗟: It is a user datagram connectionless protocol which is much faster, simpler and efficient.
